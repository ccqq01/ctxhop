// Package adapter defines the per-Agent compatibility layer.
//
// Everything that knows how a specific AI coding agent stores its sessions on
// disk lives behind this interface: where the files are, how to read them
// without disturbing a running agent, which parts of them are bound to absolute
// paths, and how to write them back atomically.
//
// Nothing above this layer may assume any particular on-disk format. Adding
// support for a new agent means adding one implementation here and touching no
// sync logic (§8.2).
//
// Agents change their internal structures without notice, so implementations
// must degrade rather than guess: read leniently, write conservatively (§9.9).
